TaskList
- Get all likes for a specific post.
- query data to get from database.
- Query the likes table with the post id.

This is good making a questions.md but make sure you delete it after pushing again. 
I am going to say that this was a good first attempt but I ask you to console.log and test that the variables you make are holding something on their own as well. And use the browser to test before you send it up again. 
Also look at what you are coding and make sure it makes sense. You sending the code to me to test should be the very last thing and we only wanna do it to make sure it works. I understand that it's hard to see alot of mistakes especially when you are confused which is why I am asking that you take a look again and then send it back up tomorrow.
